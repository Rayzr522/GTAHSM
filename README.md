# GTAHSM
> A GTA Heat seeking missile plugin.

This plugin was originally developed by [@EndureBlackout](https://github.com/EndureBlackout), I just cleaned it up and set it up to compile with Maven.

## Building
Just clone the repository and run:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
```
The built JAR can then be found in the `target` folder.
